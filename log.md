# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on React info from Codecademy. Debugged Python code at work that interacts with Tealium. Worked on a custom slack alert JavaScript implementation. _Started Advanced JSX course._

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed working with JavaScript today. The Python code gave me a few problems with the Tealium Sync I have not figured out yet.

### Day 1: September 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a quick Python script that is called by Alfred to generate 24 hour date formats for me (needed for my 9-5). [Updated my portfolio](https://creatingdrew.com) to be more accessible. Completed a pull request for ES6 JS that sends slack alerts depending on a feature in WordPress. 30 minutes of advanced JSX tutorials as well.

**Thoughts**: Tealium continues to be frustrating but the script above makes a manual sync happen in seconds.

### Day 2: September 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made it through ~~8~~ 16, and counting, lessons of Advanced JSX on Codecademy. 

**Thoughts**: Having fun :smile: Got distracted a bit wondering if there was a new "latest and greatest" course I should be going through. Fought through that and remembered sticking with something is more important.
