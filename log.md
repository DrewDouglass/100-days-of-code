# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on React info from Codecademy. Debugged Python code at work that interacts with Tealium. Worked on a custom slack alert JavaScript implementation.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed working with JavaScript today. The Python code gave me a few problems with the Tealium Sync I have not figured out yet.
